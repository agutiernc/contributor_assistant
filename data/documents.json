(That's what has happened when you see something like \"This branch is 1 commit behind hackforla:gh-pages\" on the github website version of your hackforla repository.)  \nOne way to keep your fork up to date with this repository is to follow these instruction: [Syncing your fork to the original repository via the browser](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser)  \nYou can also update your fork via the local clone of your fork, using these instructions. Assuming you have a local clone with remotes `upstream` (this repo) and `origin` (your GitHub fork of this repo):  \n* First, you will need to create a local branch which tracks upstream/gh-pages.  You will only need to do this once; you do not need to do this every time you want to incorporate upstream changes.  \nRun the following two commands:  \n```bash\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout -b upstream-gh-pages --track upstream/gh-pages\n```  \nIf you have already created the branch upstream-gh-pages, the following commands will incorporate upstream changes:  \n```bash\ngit checkout upstream-gh-pages # Move to the branch you want to merge with.\ngit pull  # This updates your tracking branch to match the gh-pages branch in this repository\ngit checkout gh-pages  # Move back to your gh-pages branch\ngit merge upstream-gh-pages  # Merge to bring your gh-pages current.\n```\nIf you do all your work on topic branches (as suggested above) and keep gh-pages free of local modifications, this merge should apply cleanly.  \nThen push the merge changes to your GitHub fork:  \n```bash\ngit push\n```  \nIf you go to your online github repository this should remove the message \"This branch is x commit behind hackforla:gh-pages\".",
